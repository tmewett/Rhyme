**Rhyme** is an ongoing experiment and educational project for

*   me to learn about the theory and implementation of type systems;
*   exploring the addition of a type system to a primitive stack language such
    as Forth, while introducing minimal complexity and new concepts.

Forth has several big design constraints, such as single-pass execution and no
variables or bindings. But it also keeps a very thin line between
"interpretation" and "compilation," which made it interesting to me to explore
advanced typing concepts which break the usual static divide between them.

Simply install Ruby and run `rhyme` to start.
